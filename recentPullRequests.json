This way effects that require very specific draw order of meshes can be made and copied without having to adjust or consider the render orders for the entire scene. It is similar in behavior to the `z-index` property in css.\r\n\r\nThis approach will have no performance impact other a couple conditions and no change in behavior when not using a render group and does not require a separate flag on the renderer to enable it. The tests from #19346 show that the behavior of WebGLRenderLists remains the same.\r\n\r\n~The current handling of transparent objects in this PR means that if a transparent object is within a render group then it will be rendered after the opaque objects in the render group, not globally.~ Transparent objects are now rendered after everything in the order specified by the groups `renderOrder`.\r\n\r\nIf my plan or desired behavior is unclear please let me know and I can try to elaborate more clearly.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Upcoming</summary>\r\n\r\n**Step 2**\r\n- Update \"sort\" function in WebGLRenderLists to sort render groups.\r\n- Update `renderObjects` to handle render group items.\r\n- Add the RenderGroup class.\r\n- Update `projectObject` to push and pop render groups.\r\n- Update WebGLRenderLists.d.ts.\r\n\r\n**Step 3**\r\n- Update stencil example to use new API.\r\n\r\n**Step 4**\r\n- Determine what to do with the existing renderOrder behavior.\r\n</details>",

Please tell me if some of the processes are wrong.\r\n\r\nThe steps I took:\r\n1. Clone  https://github.com/donmccurdy/KTX-Parse\r\n2. Check out the release tag: `git fetch --all && git checkout v0.7.1`\r\n3. Remove `--no-compress` in package.json\r\n4. Run `yarn && yarn dist`\r\n5. Copy and paste from `dist/ktx-parse.esm.js` to `examples/jsm/libs/ktx-parse.module.js`\r\n6. Remove `//# sourceMappingURL=ktx-parse.esm.js.map`",

        "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nThe methods `WebGLRenderer.compile()` and `WebGLRenderer.compileAsync()` fail when trying to compile custom objects that define a `material` property. My use case involves objects that manage child meshes. The composite objects provide access to an inner, shared material via a getter for convenience.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the error, uncomment line 47 or 48 in the following example: https://jsfiddle.net/7nvcjwk8/\r\n\r\n```\r\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: geometry is undefined\r\n    getParameters WebGLPrograms.js:77\r\n    getProgram WebGLRenderer.js:1631\r\n    prepareMaterial WebGLRenderer.js:921\r\n    compile WebGLRenderer.js:999\r\n    traverse Object3D.js:536\r\n    traverse Object3D.js:542\r\n    compile WebGLRenderer.js:980\r\n    compileAsync WebGLRenderer.js:1019\r\n    init webgl_geometry_cube.html:65\r\n    <anonymous> webgl_geometry_cube.html:37\r\nWebGLPrograms.js:77\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `compile` method to only process renderable objects, similar to how it's done in `WebGLRenderer.projectObject()`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, `Object3D` could define `isRenderable` with a default value of `false` and the renderable sub classes could set this flag to `true`.",

Where obj[str] syntax is used, the object properties must all consistently use string syntax rather than dot syntax to avoid being broken by property mangling. These changes ought to be a no-op and have no impact on any usage other than making property-mangling minify work better, since when not using property mangling, there is no meaningful difference between dot and string syntax for object properties.\r\n\r\nThis change does not provide full support for property-mangling across the entire three.js codebase. In testing this shows that the core does have support for property mangling. However it still fails with some other modules, such as `GLTFLoader` - it looks like the next big problem is that this and a few other parts of the codebase rely on parsing JSON. As the property names loaded from JSON must all be preserved, they must all also be updated to use string syntax. This looks like a bigger and more complex change, but can probably be done in a follow-up. Meanwhile this PR is a significant step towards supporting property mangling in three.js, and it should not have any negative impact on anything else.",

You could add the controls directly to the scene to render the gizmo (the visual helpers) but the `Object3D` methods `attach()` and `detach()` were overwritten with control specific methods.\r\n\r\nThe new approach is conceptually cleaner and more consistent compared to all other controls. But since `TransformControls` is no 3D object anymore, developers must add the gizmo differently now. So instead of:\r\n```js\r\nscene.add( controls );\r\n```\r\nIt is now:\r\n```js\r\nscene.add( controls.getGizmo() );\r\n```",

Ideally could be used for providing pre-written compute operations that are fast and useful out of the box ( bitonic sort, prefix sum ). This would probably be less useful to the end user, though those only targeting WebGPU devices may find some benefit out of using this functionality.\r\n\r\nIf requested, I can try to provide samples for some of this functionality, like porting the existing WebGPU Bitonic sort sample or doing something with spatial hashing and prefix sums, though this will likely require the ability to query the value of local_invocation_id and workgroup_id within TSL. \r\n\r\n- [x] Node implementation\r\n- [x] Storage Buffer Sample Fix\r\n- [x] Bespoke Workgroup Array Sample",

I just noted that the `Editor.moveObject()` method is not used. \r\n\r\nThe logic is already implemented in both `UIOutliner` and `MoveObjectCommand`. But I personally find the name `moveObject` (even for the command name) a bit misleading as I expect the Object3D to physically move in the scene as a first though, maybe renaming the `MoveObjectCommand` might be a good thing to do if you agree.",

If geometry data require a special decompression in the shader, things like ray casting or bounding volume computation won't work on the JS side (unless the engine is modified).\r\n\r\nThe decompression in the shader stage is something that we can achieve easier with TSL in the future so this is one more reasons to keep `GeometryCompressionUtils` around.",

If required, an instance of `DragControls` can now be created without a DOM element. When the element is set at a later point, a manual call of `connect()` configures the event listeners.\r\n",

I tested that straight away too. In my app I had no impact on the existing code, but I can now copy textures into array textures. The 1 in line 1450 means that only one layer should be copied.\r\n",
